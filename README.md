Go to a directory where you want to download the project, say ~/Projects
Open a console and type: git clone git://github.com/eric-naguras/MyApp.git

When git finished downloading type cd MyApp/myApp/
Then type meteor to start the app.
You will see "Running on: http://localhost:3000/" in the console
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000

I'm just a beginner with java/coffeescript and node/meteor.

If you find ways to improve the code, please let me know so I can incorporate
those changes into this project for others (and myself) te learn.

This projects uses

meteor (http://meteor.com/)
coffeescript (http://coffeescript.org/)
bootstrap (https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/)
