A "backlog management" app. Note it's a work in progress, not all features/adjustments I'd like are included. Licensed under MIT.

Would love to hear from you (feedback etc): michael.keisu@gmail.com

TODO's:
* Responsive Design, more adjustsments in css, 
* Possibility to assign tasks to other users,
* Event flow (user x completed this or that)
* Access allowed by invitation only.
.. a lot more
