OfficeContacts
==============

Meteor app in progress. A contact/calendar/resources manager for small offices

I kindly used a project from Stuard Rackham as a starting point for this projects.   
See http://srackham.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/meteor-leaderboard-with-coffeescript-less-and-bootstrap/


To everyone one following this project:
I'm trying out some things in a seperate project.
Later I will incorporate those things into this project.

The other project has a working pager for browsing through a large record set.
It comes with a test set of 1000 records.

Next step will be implementing sorting by clicking on a column header.

the test project is at: git://github.com/eric-naguras/MyApp.git
